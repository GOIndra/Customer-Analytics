Keypoints:

1) At the end of 2020 we see only around 2% were free trial users


2) In 2021 uto April month as per data, there was no free trial users that indicates there are no new customers 
   here in foodifie that is real alarming condition


3) The churn rate increased significantly from 2020 to 2021. In 2020 the churn rate was 23.6%
   and in 2021 the churn rate 37.8%. 
                                     More importantly there is no new customers in 2021, so a 
   severe downfall of the business is predicted from this dataset.


4) No of trials or new customers visits in foodifie started dropping since september,2020 and eventually
   there is no record of new customers in 2021, in 2021 the only revenue is coming from pre-existing customers.
 

5)  After free trial plan the conversion to the basic monthly plan and then pro monthly plan is really impressive.
    But after that there is a significant drop around 28.8% for the annual plan customer percentage.


6) The reason of the significant drop in annual plan needs to be found out as  pro monthly 58.6% customers'  next plan
   data are missing, 20.8% have churned only 20.6% are known to move towards the annual plan. Thus the data needs to be 
   rectified or causes need to be found why customers are not happy with pro monthly plan.


7) A positive side is the customers who have taken the annual plan after their free trial, the avg days is 105 days ie really 
   impressive.
